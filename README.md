# 412FR-Donation-NLP-Tool
Natural language processing tool to help 412 Food Rescue accurately categorize food donations.

The goal is to create a tool which would allow food donors to report what they have to donate in plain English, then translate that into quantities, units, and food types that 412FRâ€™s matching algorithm can use.
